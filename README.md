This is the repository of Syed Karhani.

I am going to use ~~Python~~ Markdown in this class.

The class is at [CBS](https://cbs.de).

We are going to learn:

- How digital organisations work.
- What modern types of organisations exist.
- Present in the browser.

We are also pretending we are developers, because:

1. We use the CLI.
2. We learn about the GitHub workflow.
3. We will make a presentation in the browser.
4. We are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed ourselves.
