# Is Hierarchy a Natural Order?

Hierarchy refers to a system of ranking and organizing individuals, groups, or things in order of importance, power, or authority. This can take many forms, including social hierarchies, organizational hierarchies, and hierarchical structures in nature.

In a holacratic organization, there are no traditional managers or hierarchical structures. Instead, teams are organized into self-governing circles that are responsible for specific functions or projects. Each circle has a set of roles with defined responsibilities and accountabilities, and members of the circle are empowered to make decisions within their roles.

The holacracy system also includes regular meetings and processes to facilitate communication, coordination, and continuous improvement within the organization. There is a strong emphasis on transparency, accountability, and continuous learning and adaptation.

Proponents of holacracy argue that it can increase agility and responsiveness, enable more effective collaboration and innovation, and foster a stronger sense of engagement and ownership among employees. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential for confusion, conflict, and power struggles in a system that lacks clear lines of authority and accountability.
