Holacracy

# Holacracy

Holacracy is a system of organizational governance that aims to distribute authority and decision-making power among all members of a team or organization. It was developed by Brian Robertson in 2007 and is based on the principles of self-organization, distributed control, and adaptive management.

In a holacratic organization, there are no traditional managers or hierarchical structures. Instead, teams are organized into self-governing circles that are responsible for specific functions or projects. Each circle has a set of roles with defined responsibilities and accountabilities, and members of the circle are empowered to make decisions within their roles.

The holacracy system also includes regular meetings and processes to facilitate communication, coordination, and continuous improvement within the organization. There is a strong emphasis on transparency, accountability, and continuous learning and adaptation.

Proponents of holacracy argue that it can increase agility and responsiveness, enable more effective collaboration and innovation, and foster a stronger sense of engagement and ownership among employees. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential for confusion, conflict, and power struggles in a system that lacks clear lines of authority and accountability.
